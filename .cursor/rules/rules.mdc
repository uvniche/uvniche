# Commit and Push Workflow

When the user says "commit & push", follow this specific workflow:

1. **Add all files and commit to dev branch**
   - Add all files (including untracked files) using `git add .`
   - Stage and commit all current changes to the dev branch
   - Use a descriptive commit message

2. **Merge dev into main**
   - Switch to main branch
   - Merge dev branch into main

3. **Push both branches**
   - Push the dev branch
   - Push the main branch

4. **Switch back to dev branch**
   - Switch back to the dev branch for continued development

This ensures both branches stay in sync and all changes are properly versioned across both development and main branches.

# Pull Latest Workflow

When the user says "pull latest" or "sync with remote", follow this specific workflow:

1. **Stash local changes**
   - Stash any uncommitted work using `git stash`

2. **Clean untracked files**
   - Remove untracked files using `git clean -fd`

3. **Sync main branch**
   - Switch to main branch
   - Pull latest changes from remote main

4. **Sync dev branch**
   - Switch to dev branch
   - Pull latest changes from remote dev

5. **Switch back to dev branch**
   - Ensure you're on dev branch for continued development

This ensures both branches are fully synced with the remote repository and you're ready to continue development.
