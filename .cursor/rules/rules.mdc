# Commit and Push Workflow

When the user says "commit & push", follow this specific workflow:

1. **Add all files and commit to dev branch**
   - Add all files (including untracked files) using `git add .`
   - Stage and commit all current changes to the dev branch
   - Use a descriptive commit message

2. **Merge dev into main**
   - Switch to main branch
   - Merge dev branch into main

3. **Push both branches**
   - Push the dev branch
   - Push the main branch

4. **Switch back to dev branch**
   - Switch back to the dev branch for continued development

This ensures both branches stay in sync and all changes are properly versioned across both development and main branches.
