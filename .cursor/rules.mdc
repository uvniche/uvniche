# LaTeX Auto-Compilation Rule

Whenever you make changes to a LaTeX file (.tex), automatically compile it using the appropriate LaTeX compiler (xelatex for files using fontspec package, pdflatex otherwise) to generate the PDF output.

After compilation, always delete auxiliary LaTeX files (.aux, .log, .out, .nav, .toc, .snm) to keep the directory clean.

## MCP Configuration Reference

When working with MCP servers or needing to check MCP functionality, always reference the MCP configuration file at `.cursor/mcp.json` in the root directory. This file contains the configuration for:

- GitHub MCP server with authentication
- Context7 MCP server for library documentation
- Playwright MCP server for web automation

Use this configuration to verify MCP server status and troubleshoot any MCP-related issues.

# Commit and Push Workflow

When the user says "commit & push", follow this specific workflow:

1. **Add all files and commit to dev branch**
   - Add all files (including untracked files) using `git add .`
   - Stage and commit all current changes to the dev branch
   - Use a descriptive commit message

2. **Merge dev into main**
   - Switch to main branch
   - Merge dev branch into main

3. **Push both branches**
   - Push the dev branch
   - Push the main branch

4. **Switch back to dev branch**
   - Switch back to the dev branch for continued development

This ensures both branches stay in sync and all changes are properly versioned across both development and main branches.

# Pull Latest Workflow

When the user says "pull latest" or "sync with remote", follow this specific workflow:

1. **Stash local changes**
   - Stash any uncommitted work using `git stash`

2. **Clean untracked files**
   - Remove untracked files using `git clean -fd`

3. **Sync main branch**
   - Switch to main branch
   - Pull latest changes from remote main

4. **Sync dev branch**
   - Switch to dev branch
   - Pull latest changes from remote dev

5. **Switch back to dev branch**
   - Ensure you're on dev branch for continued development

This ensures both branches are fully synced with the remote repository and you're ready to continue development.

# CRITICAL: Never Commit & Push Without Permission

**NEVER commit and push code changes without explicit user permission.** 

- Only execute git operations when the user specifically requests them
- This rule overrides all other workflow rules
- The user must explicitly say "commit & push" or similar command
- **IMPORTANT: Permission is NOT persistent. You must get explicit permission each time.**

# User Permission Rule

**When the user says "commit & push", that is sufficient permission for that specific request.**

- Execute the commit & push workflow immediately without asking for additional confirmation
- Permission applies ONLY to that single operation
- Do not reuse prior permission for future operations  
- Each new "commit & push" request grants permission for that operation only
- Never assume permission to commit & push automatically in future requests

## Documentation Style

Keep all documentation simple, direct, and straight to the point.

- No fluff or unnecessary explanations
- State exactly what is needed
- Nothing more, nothing less
