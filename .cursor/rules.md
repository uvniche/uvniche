# Cursor Rules

## Git Workflow Rules

### Rule 1: Commit & Push Process
When the user says "commit & push", follow this exact workflow:
1. Commit all changes to the current `dev` branch
2. Merge `dev` into `main` branch
3. Push both `dev` and `main` branches to remote

This ensures all changes are properly committed to dev, merged into main, and both branches are synchronized with the remote repository.
